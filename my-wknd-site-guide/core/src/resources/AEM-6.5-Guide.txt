Different ways to get ResourceResolver in aem
................................................
Adapt from SlingHttpServletRequest:
You can adapt a SlingHttpServletRequest to obtain a ResourceResolver. 
This is often used in request-based contexts,
such as servlets and request filters
SlingHttpServletRequest request = ...; // Obtain the request object
ResourceResolver resourceResolver = request.getResourceResolver();

Adapt from Resource:
If you have a specific resource, you can adapt it to a ResourceResolver. 
This is useful when you're working with a specific resource and want to perform operations on it.
Resource resource = ...; // Obtain the resource object
ResourceResolver resourceResolver = resource.getResourceResolver();

Service User:
You can obtain a ResourceResolver using a service user. 
Service users are typically used for long-running background processes and automation.

ResourceResolverFactory resourceResolverFactory = ...; // Injected OSGi service
Map<String, Object> serviceUserProps = new HashMap<>();
serviceUserProps.put(ResourceResolverFactory.SUBSERVICE, "service-user-name");
ResourceResolver serviceResourceResolver = resourceResolverFactory.getServiceResourceResolver(serviceUserProps);

Administrative ResourceResolver:
Be cautious when using an administrative ResourceResolver, as it has broad access to the repository. 
It's typically used for administrative scripts and is not recommended for regular application code.

ResourceResolverFactory resourceResolverFactory = ...; // Injected OSGi service
ResourceResolver adminResourceResolver = resourceResolverFactory.getAdministrativeResourceResolver(null);

Scripting and JSPs:
In JSPs and other scripting languages (e.g., HTL/Sightly), 
you can access a ResourceResolver using the resourceResolver object available by default.

<%
ResourceResolver resourceResolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(session);
%>


ResourceResolverFactory from OSGi Service:
You can obtain a ResourceResolverFactory from the OSGi service registry and 
then create a ResourceResolver from it.

ResourceResolverFactory resourceResolverFactory = ...; // Injected OSGi service
ResourceResolver resourceResolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(null);


Custom AuthenticationInfo:
You can create a custom AuthenticationInfo object and pass it to ResourceResolverFactory 
to obtain a ResourceResolver with specific authentication details.

AuthenticationInfo authInfo = new SimpleCredentials("username", "password".toCharArray());
ResourceResolverFactory resourceResolverFactory = ...; // Injected OSGi service
ResourceResolver resourceResolver = resourceResolverFactory.getResourceResolver(authInfo);


clientlib example
...............................................................
As an example:

You have a clientlib in /apps/myproject/clientlibs/foo
You have a static image in /apps/myprojects/clientlibs/foo/resources/icon.png
Then you set the allowProxy property on foo to true.

You can then request /etc.clientlibs/myprojects/clientlibs/foo.js
You can then reference the image via /etc.clientlibs/myprojects/clientlibs/foo/resources/icon.png

When to use cq:EditConfig
Personally, I end up using cq:EditConfigs on many of the components I write. 
They are especially useful on components which:

1.May not display content - After all how can you hover over something you canâ€™t see
2.Do not need to be edited by authors
3.Should not be moved, deleted or copied
4.Need advanced functionality

Dialog Replacement with cq:EditConfig
.....................................
One of the nice features about the cq:EditConfig is you can use 
it to get components to show up in the sidekick which do not have a dialog. 
This is something that I see every so often, 
usually with the developer instead creating an empty dialog. 
To get around this, simply create a cq:EditConfig where the cq:actions has every action except edit.

Listeners
Another common thing to do with an edit config is add a listener to refresh
 the page when a component is edited. 
 This is useful when a component requires JavaScript to run correctly. 
 To add a listener, add a child node called cq:listeners with the primary type cq:EditListenersConfig as shown below:

<jcr:root xmlns:cq="http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0" xmlns:jcr="http://www.jcp.org/jcr/1.0"
	cq:actions="[text:My Component,-,edit,delete,insert,copymove]"
	cq:dialogMode="floating"
	cq:layout="editbar"
	jcr:primaryType="cq:EditConfig">
	<cq:listeners
		jcr:primaryType="cq:EditListenersConfig"
		afteredit="REFRESH_PAGE"/>
</jcr:root>
